      "description": "<p><strong>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion</strong> is a standalone game that takes place before the events of Gloomhaven. The game includes four new characters — Valrath Red Guard (tank, crowd control), Inox Hatchet (ranged damage), Human Voidwarden (support, mind-control), and Quatryl Demolitionist (melee damage, obstacle manipulation) — that can also be used in the original Gloomhaven game.</p>\r\n<p>The game also includes 16 monster types (including seven new standard monsters and three new bosses) and a new campaign with 25 scenarios that invites the heroes to investigate a case of mysterious disappearances within the city. Is it the work of Vermlings, or is something far more sinister going on?</p>\r\n<p>Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion is aimed at a more casual audience to get people into the gameplay more quickly. All of the hard-to-organize cardboard map tiles have been removed, and instead players will play on the scenario book itself, which features new artwork unique to each scenario. The last barrier to entry — i.e., learning the game — has also been lowered through a simplified rule set and a five-scenario tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.</p>",

      "faq": "<p><strong>Is this compatible with the original Gloomhaven?</strong></p>\n<p>All<strong>&nbsp;</strong>new characters introduced in this game are fully compatible with Gloomhaven. Other elements such as new monsters and items cannot be carried over.</p>\n<p><strong>How many scenarios are in this game?</strong></p>\n<p>There are 25 scenarios, of which the first 5 are tutorials that will slowly get you up to speed on the rules. While it starts out slow, you'll find a noticeable step up in difficulty on scenario 4.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I play this solo?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. In fact, many board gamers regard Gloomhaven as one of the top solo games out there. But beware that the solo rules require managing two characters. This may put off some solo gamers who feel like it's too much work, while others will enjoy the rich tactical decision-making and discovering the synergy between different classes.</p>\n<p><strong>Does this game require a Dungeon Master (DM)?</strong></p>\n<p>No, but if you'd like to try adding a DM for your group, then take a look at some of the suggestions on <a href=\"https://neuralnetgames.com/does-gloomhaven-have-a-dm/\">this article</a>. The DM could handle admin duties such as moving the monsters and keeping track of status effects, and help accentuate the theme with storytelling.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">Should I play this before the original game?</strong></p>\n<p>If you're not ready to commit to a $100+ Gloomhaven purchase, go for Jaws of the Lion first. The rulebook \"hand holds\" you through the first five tutorial scenarios, and the scenario book drastically reduces setup and cleanup time by replacing the traditional map tiles. This solution was so well received by fans and reviewers that designer Isaac Childres is developing scenario books for <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/RLlDWHh7hR/gloomhaven\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'RLlDWHh7hR', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Gloomhaven</a>&nbsp;and <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/yTs3H7dTLM/frosthaven\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'yTs3H7dTLM', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Frosthaven</a>.</p>",

Now you will lead an expedition to explore the island, find lost artifacts, and face fearsome guardians, all in a quest to learn the island's secrets.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Lost Ruins of Arnak</strong></em> combines deck-building and worker placement in a game of exploration, resource management, and discovery. In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island. Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential. You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now? And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!?</p>\r\n<p>Decks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board. With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge.</p>\r\n<p>Discover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!</p>",

      "description_preview": " On an uninhabited island in uncharted seas, explorers have found traces of a great civilization. Now you will lead an expedition to explore the island, find lost artifacts, and face fearsome guardians, all in a quest to learn the island's secrets. \r\n   Lost Ruins of Arnak   combines deck-building and worker placement in a game of exploration, resource management, and discovery. In addition to traditional deck-builder effects, cards can also be used to place workers, and new worker actions become available as players explore the island. Some of these actions require resources instead of workers, so building a solid resource base will be essential. You are limited to only one action per turn, so make your choice carefully... what action will benefit you most now? And what can you afford to do later... assuming someone else doesn't take the action first!? \r\n Decks are small, and randomness in the game is heavily mitigated by the wealth of tactical decisions offered on the game board. With a variety of worker actions, artifacts, and equipment cards, the set-up for each game will be unique, encouraging players to explore new strategies to meet the challenge. \r\n Discover the Lost Ruins of Arnak!

      "description": "<p>Arrakis. Dune. Desert. Planet. Raise your banner above the vast wasteland before you. As the Great Houses of the Landsraad marshal their forces and their spies, whom will you influence, and whom will you betray? A tyrannical Emperor. The secretive Bene Gesserti. The shrewd Spacing Guild. The ferocious Fremen of the Deep Desert. The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it.</p>\r\n<p>Dune: Imperium blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions. Will you seek political allies or rely upon military might? Economic strength or subtle intrigues? A council seat...or a sharpened blade? The cards are dealt. The choice is yours.

      "faq": "<p><strong>Why do some descriptions of this game say that it's the first original Dune board game in 40 years? What about <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/gvhGefZQBd/dune-board-game\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'gvhGefZQBd', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Dune (2019)</a>?</strong></p>\n<p>Dune (2019) was mostly a cosmetic upgrade of the <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/iBIEAB4abV/dune\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'iBIEAB4abV', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">original game</a> released in 1979. This latest release from Dire Wolf Digital is set in the same universe but its core mechanisms are centered on worker placement and deck building.</p>\n<p><strong>How does the solo mode or two player gameplay work?</strong></p>\n<p>Since the original <a class=\"game-preview\" href=\"/game/gvhGefZQBd/dune-board-game\" data-tipped-options=\"ajax: {data: { ids: 'gvhGefZQBd', client_id: 'W0AQGbjlZE' }}\">Dune</a> excels at high player counts, one of the primary goals of Dune: Imperium was to create a more accessible game set in the Dune universe that doesn't rely on always having a large group. The challenge was that the core gameplay of the new game utilizes worker placement mechanism and conflict, two elements that thrive on interaction between larger number of players. Once Dire Wolf nailed the 3-4 player dynamic, Dire Wolf created an app-based automated opponent to mimic that tension even at 1-2 players.</p>\n<p>The 2p-gameplay will add House Hagal. This opponent will mainly create tension by blocking off worker placement areas, and will require minimum upkeep since it won't acquire resources or victory points.</p>\n<p>In the solo mode, you will choose a difficulty setting and select two Rivals to play against. These opponents will not only create tension around worker placement, but also compete for resources and turn them into victory points to try and win against you.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\">What's inside the Deluxe Upgrade Pack?</strong></p>\n<p>The Deluxe Upgrade Pack can be purchased on <a href=\"https://shop.direwolfdigital.com/products/dune-imperium-deluxe-upgrade-pack\">Dire Wolf's website</a>. Here's what's inside the upgrade box:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4 Alliance Token miniatures</li>\n<li>12 Agent miniatures (with base rings)</li>\n<li>1 Mentat miniature</li>\n<li>48 Troop miniatures</li>\n<li>1 First Player coin</li>\n<li>Card and component trays</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Will the Deluxe Upgrade Pack fit inside the base game box?</strong></p>\n<p>No, it's the other way around. The upgrade pack comes inside an oversized box with plastic storage that can contain all of the content of the base game.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://d2k4q26owzy373.cloudfront.net/700x700/games/userfiles/1615361386825-dune%20imperium%20deluxe%20upgrade.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>",

The power of the Imperium can be yours, but war is not the only way to claim it. \r\n Dune: Imperium blends deck-building and worker placement in a deeply thematic new strategy game where the fate of the Empire hangs on your decisions.

The Imperium awaits. "

      "description": "<p><strong>Calico</strong> is a puzzly tile-laying game of quilts and cats. In Calico, players compete to sew the coziest quilt as they collect and place patches of different colors and patterns. Each quilt has a particular pattern that must be followed, and players are also trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats!</p>\r\n<p>Turns are simple. Select a single patch tile from your hand and sew it into your quilt, then draw another patch into your hand from the three available. If you are able to create a color group, you may sew a button onto your quilt. If you are able to create a pattern combination that is attractive to any of the cats, it will come over and curl up on your quilt!</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the game, you score points for buttons, cats, and how well you were able to complete your unique quilt pattern.</p>",

      "faq": "<p><strong>What does calico mean?</strong></p>\n<p>Calico refers to the patchy color pattern on some cats. There's also a dual meaning here since it can refer to a type of fabric you can use for making quilts.</p>\n<p><strong>Is the publisher aware that's not a calico cat?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. According to Flatout Games, \"Our artist Beth thought a patchy calico cat on top of a patchwork quilt would look too busy. She encouraged us to go in a different direction. As soon as we saw her beautiful illustration of an orange tabby we fell in love! (We&rsquo;re pretty sure you did, too!) Luckily, we chose the name &lsquo;Calico&rsquo; for the game because it has a dual meaning - not only a coloration of cat, calico is also a type of fabric you can use to make a quilt!\"</p>\n<p><strong>How do you play this game?</strong></p>\n<p>Here's a video that combines the teach, playthrough, and a review all in one:</p>\n<div>\n<div class=\"d-block d-sm-none\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtYVPqSdkNQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"170\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"d-none d-sm-block\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xtYVPqSdkNQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div>\n<div class=\"d-none d-sm-block\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>This game is out of stock everywhere.

In Calico, players compete to sew the coziest quilt as they collect and place patches of different colors and patterns. Each quilt has a particular pattern that must be followed, and players are also trying to create color and pattern combinations that are not only aesthetically pleasing, but also able to attract the cuddliest cats! \r\n Turns are simple. Select a single patch tile from your hand and sew it into your quilt, then draw another patch into your hand from the three available. If you are able to create a color group, you may sew a button onto your quilt. If you are able to create a pattern combination that is attractive to any of the cats, it will come over and curl up on your quilt! \r\n At the end of the game, you score points for buttons, cats, and how well you were able to complete your unique quilt pattern.

The gods have brought you here, and you must wake them if you wish to return home.”</em></p>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>Sleeping Gods</strong></em>, you and a friend become Captain Sofi Odessa and her crew, lost in a strange world in 1929 on your steamship, the <em>Manticore</em>. You must work together to survive, exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods so that you can return home.</p>\r\n<p><em>Sleeping Gods</em> is a campaign game. Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with a friend throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will.</p>\r\n<p>Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way.</p>\r\n<p><em>Sleeping Gods</em> is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward.</p>\r\n<p><em>Sleeping Gods</em> is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters. Your choices affect the characters and the plot of the game, and may help or hinder your chances of getting home!</p>\r\n<p>Welcome to a vast world. Your journey starts now.</p>",

The gods have brought you here, and you must wake them if you wish to return home.”  \r\n In   Sleeping Gods  , you and a friend become Captain Sofi Odessa and her crew, lost in a strange world in 1929 on your steamship, the  Manticore . You must work together to survive, exploring exotic islands, meeting new characters, and seeking out the totems of the gods so that you can return home. \r\n  Sleeping Gods  is a campaign game. Each session can last as long as you want. When you are ready to take a break, you mark your progress on a journey log sheet, making it easy to return to the same place in the game the next time you play. You can play solo or with a friend throughout your campaign. It's easy to swap players in and out at will. \r\n Your goal is to find at least fourteen totems hidden throughout the world. Like reading a book, you'll complete this journey one or two hours at a time, discovering new lands, stories, and challenges along the way. \r\n  Sleeping Gods  is an atlas game. Each page of the atlas represents only a small portion of the world you can explore. When you reach the edge of a page and you want to continue in the same direction, you simply turn to a new page and sail onward. \r\n  Sleeping Gods  is a storybook game. Each new location holds wild adventure, hidden treasures, and vivid characters. Your choices affect the characters and the plot of the game, and may help or hinder your chances of getting home! \r\n Welcome to a vast world. Your journey starts now. "

      "description": "<p>At the edge of our solar system, a dark planet may lurk. In 2015, astronomers estimated a large distant planet could explain the unique orbits of dwarf planets and other objects. Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Search for Planet X</strong> is a board game from Foxtrot Games. Players take on the role of astronomers, using observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules.</p>\r\n<p>Each round, as the earth travels around the sun, players will use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they'll mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories. This is the way that players score points.</p>\r\n<p>As more and more objects are found, players will narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points.</p>\r\n<p><em>The Search for Planet X</em> captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzly-nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process. Can you be the first to find Planet X?</p>",

      "description_preview": " At the edge of our solar system, a dark planet may lurk. In 2015, astronomers estimated a large distant planet could explain the unique orbits of dwarf planets and other objects. Since then, astronomers have been scanning the sky, hoping to find this planet. \r\n  The Search for Planet X  is a board game from Foxtrot Games. Players take on the role of astronomers, using observations and logical deductions to search for this hypothetical planet. Each game, the companion app randomly selects an arrangement of objects and a location for Planet X following predefined logic rules. \r\n Each round, as the earth travels around the sun, players will use the app to perform scans and attend conferences. As they gain information about the location of the objects, they'll mark that information on their deduction sheets. As players learn the locations of the various objects, they can start publishing theories. This is the way that players score points. \r\n As more and more objects are found, players will narrow down the possible locations for Planet X. Once a player believes they know its location and the objects on either side of it, they use the app to conduct a search. The game ends when a player successfully locates Planet X, and all players have a final chance to score some additional points. \r\n  The Search for Planet X  captures the thrill of discovery, the puzzly-nature of astronomical investigation, and the competition inherent in the scientific process. Can you be the first to find Planet X? "

By expanding their wealth and joining in the construction, they gain favor with the king. Players choose from six actions on the game board — the “action crane” — that are always available, but which are weighted with a constantly shifting array of costs and benefits. By using these actions, you can increase your resources, improve the strength of your chosen actions, and build “New Prague City”, the Charles Bridge, or city walls. You can possibly gain additional actions or even participate in the construction of St. Vitus Cathedral.</p>\r\n<p>Clever players will discover synergies between carefully timed actions and the rewards from constructing civic projects as all of the mechanisms mesh together. At the end of the game, the player who most impressed King Charles wins.</p>",

      "description_preview": "  Praga Caput Regni  is the latest game from Vladimir Suchy, the designer of Underwater Cities. \r\n In this game, players take the role of wealthy citizens who are organizing various building projects in medieval Prague. By expanding their wealth and joining in the construction, they gain favor with the king. Players choose from six actions on the game board — the “action crane” — that are always available, but which are weighted with a constantly shifting array of costs and benefits. By using these actions, you can increase your resources, improve the strength of your chosen actions, and build “New Prague City”, the Charles Bridge, or city walls. You can possibly gain additional actions or even participate in the construction of St. Vitus Cathedral. \r\n Clever players will discover synergies between carefully timed actions and the rewards from constructing civic projects as all of the mechanisms mesh together. At the end of the game, the player who most impressed King Charles wins. "

      "description_preview": "  In New York Zoo, you are designing an animal park. Build enclosures, introduce new animals, and raise their offspring. The first player to cover all the construction spaces on their zoo board with Enclosure Tiles and Attractions wins the game.  \r\n Gameplay is straightforward as you have only two options on your turn:  build a new enclosure  in your zoo, or  populate your zoo  with more animals. But be sure to time your actions well since you want your zoo to participate in as many animal breedings as possible. \r\n \r\n  Components:  \r\n 8 Double-sided Zoo Boards 1 Action Strip (main board) 45 Puzzle Piece Tiles 10 Animal Tiles 6 Special Tokens 32 Attraction Tiles 126 Custom Wooden Animal Tokens \r\n  New York Zoo  is Uwe Rosenberg’s next game in which he blends his well-known animal breeding mechanics with his polyomino puzzle system for a wonderful gameplay experience.
